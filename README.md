## Introduction üìå

Flutter lens is an app through which you can extract out text from the images and then perform various different operations with the extracted text.

Through this app I have tried merging features from different apps and have bough them to one place with such an ease and a beginner friendly UI.

## Why this Project? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project is to help people wo are unable to understand text in English or are lazy to type things.

Through this app you can directly click an snap or choose an image from your local storage and get the text out of it. With the extracted text you can perform thing like:
* Copying the text to clipboard
* Searching the text on google search
* Opening the extracted text in google maps
* Translating the text to Hindi
* Finding the meaning of the extracted text

The availability of various different features at one place and the beginner friendly UI is something which a user likes about this app.

For this project, I have worked on various domains like:
* UI/UX Development with Flutter
* Interacting with google maps
* Interacting with google search
* Interacting with [oxford dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/).
* Translating the text using translator package
* Copying the text to clipboard
